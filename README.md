# CheckMate-6.4210-final-project
This repo will contain the code for our full stack chess-playing robotic manipulation system. This system will include a perception system with one RGB-D camera, high precision grasping of the different shaped pieces with varying levels of clutter throughout the game, and motion planning constrained to keep pieces low to find short paths while still being collision-avoidant. Improving upon previous work [1], we aim to optimize this system for speed, utilize a new gripper, and implement more advanced control (TVLQR). Our stretch goal for this project will be to implement this system on two robots and have them successfully play each other with a chess timer.
